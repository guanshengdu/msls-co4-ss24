The threshold value can be set manually or determined automatically.\n",

For this, we can use a clustering algorithm such as [K-means](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering).

The similarity is measured using the (Eucledian or non-Euclidean) distance between the pixel values. The algorithm iteratively assigns pixels to clusters based on their distance to the cluster centers and updates the cluster centers based on the mean of the pixels in the cluster.

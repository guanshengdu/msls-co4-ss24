    "Thresholding segments pixels into either foreground or background based on their intensity values. Thresholding is therefore an instance of *binary* image segmentation. The algorithms work by comparing the intensity values of the pixels in an image with a threshold value.

The threshold value can be set manually or determined automatically.\n",

For this, we can use a clustering algorithm such as [K-means](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering).

The similarity is measured using the (Eucledian or non-Euclidean) distance between the pixel values. The algorithm iteratively assigns pixels to clusters based on their distance to the cluster centers and updates the cluster centers based on the mean of the pixels in the cluster. The process continues until the cluster centers converge. See here for a nice [visualization](https://www.naftaliharris.com/blog/visualizing-k-means-clustering/)) of the algorithm.\n",

    "an image. The algorithm works by flooding the image with \"water\" from different\n",
    "regions (or seed points) and letting the water flow until it reaches a boundary. \n",
    "The watershed lines are then defined as the boundaries between the regions where\n",
    "the water meets. The algorithm can be used to segment images into different regions\n",

    "The tutorial uses the following strategy: \n",
    "1. Convert the image into binary mask using thresholding\n",
    "2. Apply so-called morphological operations\\* to remove noise, and to separate the objects. We also use similar operations to identify regions that most likely represent the background of our scene.\n",

    "   1. Apply the distance transform\\*\\* to the binary image, which measures the distance of each pixel to the nearest zero pixel.\n",
    "   2. Apply a threshold to the distance-transformed image to obtain blobs of pixels that are located close to the centers of our objects of interest.\n",
    "   3. Use the connected components\\*\\*\\* algorithm to identify and enumerate the different seed points. This turns \n",

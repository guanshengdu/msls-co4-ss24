    "# **Morphological operations**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we demonstrate the effects of morphological operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Morphological operations are basic image operations that process images based on shapes. A morphological operation \n",
    "requires two inputs: an input image and a structuring element. The structuring element is a (usually binary) image that specifies \n",
    "the neighborhood used to process each pixel in the input image. It represents the shape of the operation to be performed. \n",
    "The illustration below shows common structuring elments. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Common structuring elements](../data/doc/structuring-elements-2d.svg)  \n",
    "**Figure 1**: Common structuring elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the kernels in a convolution, the structuring element is swept across the input image. However, the operations performed are different. Instead of multiplying and summing the pixel values, the morphological operations are based on set theory and logical operations (intersection, union, complement, etc.). \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the **erosion** operation (see below) computes the intersection of the image and the shifted structuring element: Only if all forground pixels (value=1) in the structuring element at a certain position overlap with forground pixels in the input image, the pixel value in the output image is set to 1 for this position, see Figure 2 Likewise, the **dilation** operation computes the union of the image and the shifted structuring element: If at least one forground pixel in the structuring element overlaps with a forground pixel in the input image, the pixel value in the output image is set to 1 for this position, see Figure 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Binary erosion](../data/doc/binary-erosion.svg)  \n",
    "**Figure 2**: Binary erosion of an input image (1) using a circular structuring element (2). Subfigures (3) and (4) show the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Binary dilation](../data/doc/binary-dilation.svg)  \n",
    "**Figure 2**: Binary dilation of an input image (1) using a circular structuring element (2). Subfigures (3) and (4) show the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Morphological operations are used for a variety of image processing tasks, such as removing noise, isolating individual elements, and enhancing features. Here, we will cover some elementary morphological operations: dilation, erosion, opening, and closing. Instead of providing formal definitions of these operations, we will explore them through examples.\n",
